synopsis: how to run the program?

details: 

Please see suggestions in code.

Did not find a task in package.json to run the program. Something like

npm run start

to see the program output without any further input is expected.

synopsis: no hard coding, please

details: 

Please see suggestions in code.

Let's write a driver program that reads a file and displays the analysis for the contents of the file. Let's exclude that driver program from the code coverage. Let us also provide a run task that when called on the build will run the program. Let us *not* include this run task in the CI default run.

synopsis~: No need to deviate from what we had before

details: 
We write code, get it to a shape, and build on it. Now, all of a sudden
the code we completed has been changed extensively. No need to do that.
If Plato complains, don't change design drastically. Instead ask for help.

details: 

Please see suggestions in code.

Let's look at the next set of tests:
-service returns some response for call
-parse true response
-parse false response
-is_spelling_correct calls service and parse
-is_spelling_correct passes through the failure from service call

synopsis~: let's revisit some tests

details: 

Let's revisit some tests.

We should not count in the number of types the words for which we could not get the true or false for spelling check.

Also, we need
Total words: 5
Typos: 2
Errors: 40%

We don't need to return list of correct words and list of error words separately.

A few more tests to consider:

-analyze takes an empty sentence
-analyze takes a correct word "hello" but runs into a network error
-analyze takes a correct word "hello" but runs into a service failure error
-analyze takes a correct word "hello there" but runs into a network failure error only for the word there

Let's remove unnecessary files like karma.conf.js

Let's take small steps. The give problem says we will talk to a service, but in the future we may use a different service. Thus, we should postpone bringin in the service so we can make the code extensible.

synopsis~: this does not have to be a web application

details: 

This does not have to be a web application. In fact, it is better not to
as we will run into issues with cross site scripting and will have to write a server side and a client side, which is really not necessary.

Let us change directions. Let's start with a node application. For this we don't need karma.conf.js. Instead, we can write a direct test using mocha and chai. Please give that a try and if you need help after a bit of effort, let me know and I can set up the files to get us moving forward.
