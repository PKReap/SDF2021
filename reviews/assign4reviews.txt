synopsis~: let's think a bit about the design before we start

details: 

Let's think about the design a bit before we start and we will tease out some initial steps.

A Wheel may have different properties. There may be more properties in the future. There are interconnected rules about the properties of Wheel and the properties of its parts. These rules may change in the future as well. It is possible that some designs may want one set of rules and another design may favor variations to those rules. We want the design to be flexible enough to make those changes.

Given this, how can we model the wheel and its parts so that they have the properties but we don't end up changing each one when the rules change? We can separate the properties from the rules to accommodate that.

The first rule is that the application gets a new wheel with some preset properties. Let's start with that.
