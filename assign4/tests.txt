    x Wheel's diameter is changed if WheelRule aproves of the change
    x Wheel's diameter is not changed if WheelRule disapproves of the change
    x When Wheel's diameter is not changed the set propagates the reason WheelRule rejected the change

tests for Hub
    x The Wheel created by WheelRule has a hub diameter of 1
    x Hub's diameter is changed if WheelRule approves of the change
    x Hub's diameter is not changed if WheelRule disapproves of the change
    x When Hub's diameter is not changed the set propagates the reason WheelRule rejected the change

    x Remove a spoke from a wheel
    x Can't remove a spoke if there are only eight
    x Can't add a spoke if all spokes can't be reasonably spaced in a wheel
    x When wheel diameter is changed the spokes length changes
    x When hub diameter is changed the spokes length changes

tests for WheelRule functions
    x approveDiameter aproves diameter of a wheel
    x approveDiameter throws error if diameter is becomes less than or equal to 0
    x approveHubDiameter aproves diameter of a hub

    x approveSpokeRemoval aproves removal of a spoke
    x approveSpokeRemoval throws error if number of spokes becomes less than 8
    x approveSpokeAdd aproves adding of a spoke
    x approveSpokeAdd throws an error if spacing is an issue
    x approveDiameter aproves diameter of wheel when it is twice the size of the hub diameter
